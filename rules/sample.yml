- id: sample.ruby.clone
  pattern:
    - clone()
    - "clone(!freeze: _)"
  message: |
    Did you mean `dup`?

    `clone` returns frozen object when receiver is frozen.

    * If object is frozen, you usually does not need to clone it
    * When you need a copy of a object, you probably want to modify that; did you mean dup?
    * Ruby 2.4 accepts freeze keyword and returns not frozen object
